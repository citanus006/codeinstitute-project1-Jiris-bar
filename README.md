## Project: Jiri's Bar

### CodeInstitute Full Stack development Course - Project 1

The live project page: https://citanus006.github.io/codeinstitute-project1-Jiris-bar/

### Project  goals

This page should provide information about the bar for potential and returning customers, who should be able to locate bar and create booking if desired. Visitors should also be able to see up to date menu together with some insight to history of offered beverages.

### Designs and mockups

Mockups and wireframes were designed using draw.io available as part of nextcloud instance running on my own server at https://nextcloud.jvitek.org. Design is intended as separate pages for each section of web presentation. 

On every page should be contact information, together with address and navigation in header and footer with links to social media.  

#### Desktop version

- Home page contains brief information about the bar, description of offered selection and links to subsequent pages.

### Testing

#### Primary testing using Google Chrome's developer tools.

Using technology available in Google Chrome browser, checking responsiveness, navigation and links. One platform at the time and ability to resize screen as well. 
 - Mobile - TBA
 - Tablet - TBA
 - Desktop (Standard screen a laptops)

Test all above devices and check all buttons and links are visible can be clicked and lead to correct sections of web presentation or external sites. Verify that contact form can be used on all platforms.

#### Secondary testing - Validation via available online tools
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Page load speed testing

### Deployment
The host for this site is [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which renders github repository as publicly accessible website. Docuemntation used to make it work can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site). 

### Technological limitation, obstacles and design decisions
 - I decided to avoid manual image compression so far as it is something what is usually done during build or deployment phase and is outside of scope of this project.
