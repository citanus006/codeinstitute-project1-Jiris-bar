# C.I. WebDev Course Milestone Project No.1

##### Project: Jiri's Bar

### The live project page: https://citanus006.github.io/codeinstitute-project1-Jiris-bar/

### Project  goals

This page should provide information about the bar for potential and returning customers, who should be able to locate bar and create booking if desired. Visitors should also be able to see up to date menu together with some insight to history of offered beverages.

### Designs and mockups

Mockups and wireframes were designed using draw.io available as part of nextcloud instance running on my own server at https://nextcloud.jvitek.org. Design is intended as separate pages for each section of web presentation. 

On every page should be contact information, together with address and navigation in header and footer with links to social media.  

#### Desktop version
